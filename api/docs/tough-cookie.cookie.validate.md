Validates cookie attributes for semantic correctness. Useful for "lint" checking any `Set-Cookie` headers you generate. For now, it returns a boolean, but eventually could return a reason string.

**Signature:**

```typescript
validate(): boolean;
```
**Returns:**

boolean

## Remarks

Works for a few things, but is by no means comprehensive.
